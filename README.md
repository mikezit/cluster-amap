# Clusterkraf

A clustering library for the Google Maps Android API v2.

If you're using the [Polaris v2](https://github.com/cyrilmottier/Polaris2) library, check out our [pleiades](https://github.com/twotoasters/clusterkraf/tree/pleiades) branch.

## Features

- Clustering based on pixel proximity, not grid membership
- Animated cluster transitions
- Supports Android v2.2 (Froyo) and higher

## Setup

### Gradle

If you are using Gradle just add the following to your build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.twotoasters.clusterkraf:library:1.0.+'
}
```

### Maven

If you are using maven add the following to your pom file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.twotoasters.clusterkraf</groupId>
    <artifactId>library</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Eclipse
It's easy to add Clusterkraf to your app. Add the Clusterkraf library folder as an Android project to your Eclipse/ADT workspace, and reference it from your app as a library project. Also, we assume you have a data object that holds latitude and longitude coordinates of each point you want plotted on the map similar to this:

```java
public class YourMapPointModel {
    public LatLng latLng;
    public YourMapPointModel(LatLng latLng) {
        this.latLng = latLng;
    }
    // encapsulation omitted for brevity
}
```

Clusterkraf provides an `InputPoint` class which holds a `LatLng` position and an `Object` tag. You just need to construct an `ArrayList<InputPoint>` object based on your model objects similar to this example. In this example, we provide the model as the `Object` tag for the `InputPoint` so that we can later pass them back to you in callbacks as the `ClusterPoint` object's pointsInCluster list; see `MarkerOptionsChooser`, `OnInfoWindowClickDownstreamListener`, and `OnMarkerClickDownstreamListener`.

```java
public class YourActivity extends FragmentActivity {
    YourMapPointModel[] yourMapPointModels = new YourMapPointModel[] { new YourMapPointModel(new LatLng(0d, 1d) /* etc */ ) };
    ArrayList<InputPoint> inputPoints;
        
    private void buildInputPoints() {
        this.inputPoints = new ArrayList<InputPoint>(yourMapPointModels.length);
        for (YourMapPointModel model : this.yourMapPointModels) {
            this.inputPoints.add(new InputPoint(model.latLng, model));
        }
    }
}
```

When your `GoogleMap` is initialized and your `ArrayList<InputPoint>` is built, you can then initialize Clusterkraf.

```java
    // YourActivity

    Clusterkraf clusterkraf;

    private void initClusterkraf() {
        if (this.map != null && this.inputPoints != null && this.inputPoints.size() > 0) {
    		com.twotoasters.clusterkraf.Options options = new com.twotoasters.clusterkraf.Options();
    		// customize the options before you construct a Clusterkraf instance
    		this.clusterkraf = new Clusterkraf(this.map, this.options, this.inputPoints);
    	}
    }
```

You've added a really sweet clustered map to your Android app.

For a more detailed example, take a look at the included sample app's source code. 

## Sample App

The sample app demonstrates Activity lifecycle, custom marker icons, click handling, and Clusterkraf's options. You can build it from source, or install it from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twotoasters.clusterkraf.sample.

### Building the Sample App

1. In your local checkout of the Clusterkraf git repo, do `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`.
2. Add sample/ as a new Android project from existing source.
3. Add sample/libs/ViewPagerIndicator as a new Android project from existing source.
4. Authorize com.twotoasters.clusterkraf.sample built with your key of choice to your Google Maps for Android v2 API account.
5. Create a new Values file `private_strings.xml` in sample/res/values/ and create a string named `maps_api_key` with your Google Maps for Android v2 API key.
